# What happens when you run the following code? Why?

NAME = 'Victor'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

NAME = 'Nina'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

# The strings will be log in the terminal. The first 3 lines will log the name Victor and the last 3 lines will log the name Nina. The NAME is a constant and should not be changed. So it should be written in lower cases instead to represent an actual variable and not a Constant
