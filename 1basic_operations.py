# 1. Concatenate two strings, one with your first name and one with your last, to create a new string with your full name as its value. 
# For example, if your name is John Doe, you should combine 'John' and 'Doe' to get 'John Doe'.

first_name = "Eric" 
last_name = "Reiss"

print(f'{first_name} {last_name}')

# 3. What does the following code do? Why?
# print('5' + '10')

print('510')

# 4. Refactor the code from the previous exercise to use coercion to print 15 instead.

print(int('5') + int('10'))
